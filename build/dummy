This is a dummy file that isn't used.
Its only purpose is to have an irrelevant file that can
be modified whenever we need to trigger a new build,
but no other commits are pending.

NOTE: these commits pollute the commit history. Where possible try to avoid them.
Some considerations:
 - Spread out landings so that there is something to push next as well,
   if patches in the tb-checkin-needed queue aren't urgent
 - Check the review queue: something quick and easy to grab from there?
 - Instead fix or improve documentation. Over time these fixes add up.

Instructions:

If a new build for comm-central is desired, edit this file,
and make a change below the line.
(For example, add another dot, or remove one.)
